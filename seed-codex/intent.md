name: "Noetic Seed"
desired_state: "A mock implementation of the vision for Noetic, to build the real Noetic. The Noetic Codex is a less-technical extension of Spec-Driven Development for the vision of Software 3.0. The Noetic Seed Codex (what you're reading now) is the Codex that implements this vision 'hacked together' via existing tools and compromises in order to enhance the development of the real Noetic and 'dog food' the ideas. The system will be run by an AlphaGo-inspired planner using a Flow Graph (a.k.a. action steps) to execute the intent using Antigravity agents, n8n, and other tools. Before we have a web interface for interacting with the system remotely, I will use Telegram via n8n to interact with the system when away from my laptop. n8n will send Antigravity's outputs to me via Telegram, and I will send Antigravity's inputs to n8n via Telegram (in addition to using the laptop itself). Interaction with the system must not bypass the planner, meaning n8n must not pass directly to Antigravity agents. We need thorough tracing and auditability from day one. An way to evaluate agents and flows will need to be implemented soon, so the tracing and auditability should be implemented with that in mind. The AlphaGo-inspired planner doesn't execute the path options but rather evaluates hypothetical paths and selects the best one to execute."
